# Book Distribution Report System
## About
In this project, I made an app using python to keep track of how many books we distributed today. In this we have to just fill the form and submit and it will be saved to the local database. And then we join databases from all the location to the default one, and thus we get all the reports of books distributed along with quantity and in which area.

## Technology Used
I used python as programming language to write the code.
Tkinter library of python to make the GUI app.
pymysql library of python to integrate local mysql database with the app.

## Results
I gave this app to ** IYF Bhopal Media ** for testing and they are using it and gave me a positive response and some feedback for improvemets also.
